# Power BI Gym Analytics Dashboard
This project is a Power BI dashboard created using real-world data collected from my local gym. The main goal was to analyze and visualize trends in gym member engagement, workout patterns, and session attendance — while sharpening my data visualization skills using Power BI.

# Project Objective
To use Power BI as a tool to transform raw gym data into actionable insights and visually intuitive reports that help understand:

Member attendance trends

Peak workout hours

Preferred workout types

Monthly engagement patterns

# Tools Used
Power BI Desktop for report building

Excel for initial data cleaning and formatting

Custom DAX formulas for KPI calculations

# Key Features
Interactive visuals and filters (date, session type, trainer)

Custom KPIs to track average attendance, consistency, and peak hours

Clean layout designed for easy understanding and quick decision-making

# Dataset Source
This dataset was collected manually from my gym’s internal logs, which included member check-in data, session logs, and engagement records over a few months.
